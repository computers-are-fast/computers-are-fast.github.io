                Let's find out how well you know computers! All of these programs
                have a variable NUMBER in them. Your mission: guess how big NUMBER
                needs to get before the program takes 1 second to run.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy measure">
                You don't need to guess exactly: they're all between 1 and a
                billion. Just try to guess the right order of magnitude! A few
                notes:
            </p>
                <ul class="lh-copy measure prxxxl-l">
                    <li class="mbs"> If the answer is 38,000, both 10,000 and 100,000 are
                        considered correct answers. The goal is to not be wrong by
                        <i>more</i> than 10x :) </li>
                    <li class="mbs"> We know computers have different disk & network & CPU
                        speeds! We're trying to get you to tell the difference
                        between code that can run 10 times/s and 100000 times/s. A
                        newer computer won't make your code run 1000x faster :)
                    </li>
                    <li class="mbs"> That said, all this was run on a new laptop with a fast
                        SSD and a sketchy network connection. The C code was compiled with <code>gcc -O2</code>.</li>

            <p class="lh-copy measure">
                Good luck! We were surprised by a lot of these. We'll be
                anonymously collecting your answers, so expect some graphs in the
                future! =D
